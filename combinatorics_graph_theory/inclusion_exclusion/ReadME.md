# Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion

## Overview
Use this principle to accurately count elements in overlapping sets. Avoid overcounting by applying inclusion-exclusion.

## Key Concepts
- Union of multiple sets
- Overlap correction
- Applications in probability and counting

## Code Included
- `inclusion_exclusion_sets.py` – Basic set-based implementation.
- `venn_diagram.ipynb` – Visualizes overlap using matplotlib-venn.
