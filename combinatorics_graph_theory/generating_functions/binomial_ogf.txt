binomial_coefficients <- functions(n){
    return(choose(n, 0:n))
}
This creates a function called binomial_coefficients that takes one input n.
Inside:
- It uses the choose() function.
- choose(n, 0:n) means:
    - Calculate nC0, nC1, nC2, ... up to nCn.
    - All bionomial coefficients for (1+x)^n

Example:
If n = 5, then choose(n, 0:n) gives:
5C0, 5C1, 5C2, 5C3, 5C4, 5C5
=> 1, 5, 10, 10, 5, 1
Which are the coefficients in the expansion of (1+x)^5.

n <- 5
You set n = 5, meaning you want to expand (1+x)^5

coefficients <- binomial_coefficients(n)
You call your function with n = 5, and save the result into a variable coefficients

cat(paste0("(1+x)^", n, " expansion coefficients (Binomial Coefficients):\n"))
print(coefficients)
- cat() prints a sentence without [] or "" around it
- past0() glues pieces together with no spaces.
