# Generating Functions

## Overview
Generating functions are algebraic tools used to solve recurrence relations and count sequences.

## Key Concepts
- Ordinary generating functions (OGF)
- Exponential generating functions (EGF)
- Coefficient extraction and closed-form solutions

## Code Included
- `ogf_fibonacci.py` – Derives Fibonacci from a generating function.
- `binomial_ogf.py` – Uses generating functions for binomial identity proofs.
