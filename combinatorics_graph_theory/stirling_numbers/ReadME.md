# Stirling Numbers of the First Kind

## Overview
These count permutations with a given number of cycles. Useful in combinatorics and algebra.

## Key Concepts
- Permutations and cycles
- Recursive relations
- Sign conventions

## Code Included
- `stirling_first_kind.py` – Recursively computes Stirling numbers.
- `cycle_permutation_visualizer.ipynb` – Demonstrates cyclic structures.
