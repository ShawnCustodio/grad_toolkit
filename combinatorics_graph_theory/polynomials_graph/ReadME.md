# Chromatic & Tutte Polynomials

## Overview
Polynomials that encode graph properties such as colorings and connectivity.

## Key Concepts
- Chromatic polynomials: # of colorings with k colors
- Tutte polynomial: generalizes several graph invariants
- Recursive definitions

## Code Included
- `chromatic_polynomial.py`
- `tutte_polynomial.py`
- Examples with small graphs
