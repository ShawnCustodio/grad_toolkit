# Counting Principles

## Overview
This section covers basic and advanced counting techniques in combinatorics including permutations, combinations, and factorial-based methods.

## Key Concepts
- Permutations and combinations
- Factorial notation
- Counting with/without replacement
- Permutations with indistinguishable objects

## Code Included
- `permutations_combinations.py` – Calculates permutations and combinations with sample problems.
- `factorial_growth_plot.ipynb` – Visualizes factorial growth.
