# Graph Algorithms

## Overview
Core graph theory algorithms for traversing, optimizing, and analyzing graphs.

## Key Concepts
- BFS & DFS
- Shortest path: Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford
- Minimum Spanning Tree: Prim, Kruskal
- Connectivity, Euler/Hamiltonian paths

## Code Included
- `dijkstra.py`, `dfs_bfs.py`, `kruskal.py`
- NetworkX visualizations of paths and trees
